### Project Description
Survival Analysis is a subfield of statistics that studies time to a specific event (such as
death or malfunction of an equipment) as a random variable. The statistical properties
of the random variable such as mean time to an event are very important in many fields
such as biostatistics and reliability engineering.
In this project, I will perform survival analysis on benchmark data and learn about
statistical tools for survival analysis such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the Cox
Proportional Hazards Model.
